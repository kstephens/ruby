=== Language changes
=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

  * Signal.trap

    See above.

  * incompatible changes:
    The :close_others option is true by default for system() and exec().
    Also, the close-on-exec flag is set by default for all new file descriptors.
    This means file descriptors doesn't inherit to spawned process unless
    explicitly requested such as system(..., fd=>fd).
